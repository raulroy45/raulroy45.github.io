# Ongoing Projects
* ### Autonomous Remote Controller Toy Car
[Project Repository](https://github.com/raulroy45/autonomous-toycar)
    * Programmed a Raspberry Pi with Python to control and direct the toy car in the intended directions.
    * Encoded a wall-detection and avoidance algorithm, using an ultrasonic sensor, to enable the car to avoid collisions.
    * Currently implementing autonomous features using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) with ROS (Robotic Operating System) and a LiDAR sensor that will map and autonomously traverse the surroundings.
